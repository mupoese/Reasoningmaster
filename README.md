# Universal Judgment Law LLM Framework

## 🧠 Multi-LLM Composite Reasoning & Training System

A revolutionary AI reasoning framework based on the **Universal Judgment Law** that processes queries through multiple LLM providers, identifies the best responses through composite scoring, and creates superior training datasets for model improvement.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This framework implements a **6-step Universal Reasoning Law**:
1. **Intensie** (Intention) - AI forms reasoning goals
2. **Oorzaak** (Cause) - Determines logical premises and constraints  
3. **Actie** (Action) - Executes reasoning and LLM processing
4. **Reactie** (Reaction) - Applies universal logical laws (immutable)
5. **Effect** - Generates results with inherent moral weight
6. **Oordeel** (Judgment) - Evaluates reasoning quality and assigns moral weight

The system processes queries through **multiple LLM providers simultaneously**, ranks responses using **composite scoring**, and creates **consensus-driven training data** for model improvement.
